# Backoffice Github Repo Automation
> A set of tools to automate multiple GitHub repository management.

As we publish a couple of libraries to multiple repositories under crvshlab, we need a set of small tools to perform management of those repositories, such as creating new repositories, updating continuous integration setup, updating dependencies, and so on.

This repository contains some scripts that may be useful for these kind of tasks.
